### Array Shift
 the challenge is to shift an array and insert a number in the middle of the array, with out using JS built-in Methods. 

### Array Binary Search 
 the challenge is to search though an array using the binary search methodology and returning the index of the searched number.

 ### Mock Interviews 
 mock interview challenge, but it became a straight code challenge, Fibonacci sequence and row summation of an array of arrays, no built-in methods used.

 ### Linked Lists 
 linked list is a new topic, so basic JS functionality is used in a class model, for creating a linked list, some basic functionality and show them as strings.
