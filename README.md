### Array Shift
 the challenge is to shift an array and insert a number in the middle of the array, with out using JS built-in Methods. 

### Array Binary Search 
 the challenge is to search though an array using the binary search methodology and returning the index of the searched number.

 ### Mock Interviews 
 mock interview challenge, but it became a straight code challenge, Fibonacci sequence and row summation of an array of arrays, no built-in methods used.

 ### Linked List 
 linked list is a new topic, so basic JS functionality is used in a class model, for creating a linked list, some basic functionality and show them as strings. 

 ### Linked List insertions 
 basic JS functionality is used in a class model, to insert node to the linked list at the end or after or before a specific node.

 ### Linked List CountBack
 this challenge focuses on looping through the linked-list in a reverse manner, and return the values in the linked list. 

 ### Linked List Merge
 this challenge is about manipulating two Linked Lists, by merging them in alternating fashion.

 ### Stack and Queue 
 a new topic, that talks about the stack and queues, how to handle them, like adding item, removing items and peeking the top or front node.

 ### Queues with Stacks


 ### fifo-animal-shelter
 this challenge is about working with queues in the First in First out terminology. 

 ### Multi Brackets Validation 
 this challenge is about validating balanced brackets, and validating a good opening and closing of the brackets.

 ### Binary-Trees
 this challenge is about creating the traversing methods for the binary tree, and some basic methods for the binary search tree.
