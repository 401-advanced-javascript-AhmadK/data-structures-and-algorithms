# Challenge 05 

# Singly linked Lists

# Challenge Summary
data structure is a new topic, in this challenge we learned how to instantiate new node, some basic operations on nodes and how to represent then in strings.

## Challenge Description
Linked List... this challenge is about Linked Lists and how to instantiate a new linked list , how to check for values, hot to test them and how to show  them as strings.

## Approach & Efficiency
The class module is used in this challenge, with constructor and the insert(), include() and toString() methods are used. the approach is using vanilla JS, to work with linked lists, for while loops and if statements are used.

### Big O
time O (n)
space O (n)

## Solution
![array-shift](assets/Linked-List.jpg)


# Challenge 06

# Linked List insertions 

# Challenge Summary
a challenge for inserting nodes, in multiple places before and after a specific node at the end or the beginnin.

## Challenge Description
insert nodes at the end or before or after a specific node.

## Approach & Efficiency
the append(), insertBefore() and insertAfter() methods are added to the class to append nodes, or adding them in a specific location. 

### Big O
time O (n)
space O (n)

## Solution
![array-shift](insert a node after the last node of the linked list)
